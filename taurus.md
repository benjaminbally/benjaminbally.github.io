TAURUS is a numerical suite that can be used to carry out advanced variational calculations for atomic nuclei.
More precisely, the suite permits to perform the configuration mixing of symmetry-projected real general Bogoliubov quasi-particle
states represented in a spherical harmonic oscillator basis.
The suite can carry out both valence-space and no-core calculations and can be used to describe even-even, odd-even and odd-odd nuclei.
More details on the theoretical framework can be found in the articles: 
[Bally et al, Eur. Phys. J. A 57, 69 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1140/epja/s10050-021-00369-z) and

The suite is composed of 3 main components (TAURUS<sub>vap</sub>, TAURUS<sub>pav</sub>, TAURUS<sub>mix</sub>) as well as
a bunch of smaller codes and scripts. The main codes are written in modern Fortran and include a hybrid OpenMP+MPI parallelization.

The repositories of the project are hosted on GitHub: [project-taurus](https://github.com/project-taurus)  

Historically, the project TAURUS started as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action (MSCA) from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research
and innovation programme under the grant agreement [No. 839847](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/839847).
The fellowship was hosted by the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid under the supervision of Tomás R. Rodríguez (now at UCM).
