Inspired by others (e.g. [Hergert, Front. Phys. 8, 379 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2020.00379)), a few years ago I created a set of nuclear charts to represent
the progress in *ab initio* calculations of atomic nuclei over the years. You can find two examples below.

A few comments:
- The experimental data are taken from the latest Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME) available: [M. Wang et al., Chinese Phys. C 45 030003 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1674-1137/abddaf).
- The data regarding energy density functional (EDF) calculations have been obtained from S. Hilaire (CEA Bruyères-le-Châtel).
- For *ab initio* methods, I do not apply strict criteria. I consider all nuclei for which a *reasonable* calculation has been performed.

Comparison between data of the Atomic Mass Evaluation of 2020, nuclei predicted to exist by the Gogny D1M energy density functional and *ab initio* calculations
as of 2023.
